# Planar-Bipedal-Walker
Implementation of a planar bipedal walking using Hybrid Zero Dynamics in Python
Working at progress. Currently get a workable and correct hybrid dynamics for 3-link walkers. Next step: build an animation sandbox. More to come  
##Future Plan:  
1. 5-link walker  
2. Trajectory Optimization using pydrake  (currently get the coefficients directly from literature)  
3. Hybrid Zero Dynamics Implementation. More theory behind the model  
4. Other control (trajectory-following) method including PID and MPC control  
5. More graceful simulation using pydrake or other tools.  

Note: Developing part-time. It takes time.
